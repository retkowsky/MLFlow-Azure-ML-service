    " 1. Retrieve a previously trained scikit-learn model\n",
    " 2. Create a Docker image from the model\n",
    " 3. Deploy the model as a web service on Azure Container Instance\n",
    " 4. Make a scoring request against the web service.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites and Set-up\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook requires you to first complete the [Use MLflow with Azure Machine Learning for Local Training Run](../train-local/train-local.ipnyb) or [Use MLflow with Azure Machine Learning for Remote Training Run](../train-remote/train-remote.ipnyb) notebook, so as to have an experiment run with uploaded model in your Azure Machine Learning Workspace.\n",
